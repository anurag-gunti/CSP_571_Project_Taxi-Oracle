## Objective: Predict number of taxi trips per areas.
That way the taxis business owners will be able to place the taxis in the correct location. For that we are thinking of using the following datasets:
- Taxi transportation data
- Weather data
- CTA public transportation data 

## Project Outline
Regarding the project planning, we will start with a data preparation phase. As we have mentioned, we have different datasets and Chicago Taxi Trips Dataset is ~70GB, so we will make a random selection of samples of the last two years until reaching 100K observations. Furthermore, in this phase we will analyze the datasets for possible errors or missing values. After that we will combine the datasets and we will start the data visualization phase to discover possible relationships between variables that will help us to develop the model. After that, we will go to the model and validation phase using the different algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks. Finally, we will do a Performance Evaluation phase, analyzing the prediction errors of our model with respect to the different areas of Chicago in order to draw conclusions about the project.
